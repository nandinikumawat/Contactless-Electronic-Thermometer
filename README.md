# Contactless-Electronic-Thermometer
## Overview
This project focuses on developing an innovative Body Temperature Detection System using a Thermopile Sensor and operational amplifiers (OpAmp). The system leverages the Stefan–Boltzmann Law to detect the energy radiated by the body, providing an instant interpretation of the body temperature.

## Components
- **Operational Amplifiers (OP2177, AD8698, OP1177):** Configured in the non-inverting operational amplifier setup to amplify the small signal from the Thermopile Sensor.
- **Resistors:** Various resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R8, RG/2) used to control the gain and linear variation of the OpAmp.
- **Capacitors (C1-C4):** Capacitors used for signal conditioning and filtering.
- **VU Meter:** Millivolt VU meter or digital mV meter for interpreting the amplified temperature level.
- **Thermopile Sensor (MLX90247):** Utilized to detect the energy radiated by the body based on the Stefan–Boltzmann Law.
- **Thermistor:** Incorporated to detect the ambient temperature for reference.
- **Battery:** 9V battery for powering the system.

## Operational Amplifiers
Operational amplifiers are configured to amplify the small potential generated by the Thermopile Sensor. The non-inverting operational amplifier configuration ensures linear variation between input and output signals.

## Stefan–Boltzmann Law
The Stefan–Boltzmann Law describes the power radiated from a black body in terms of its temperature. The project utilizes this law to correlate the infrared radiance from the body to its temperature.

## Working Principle
The project detects the energy radiated by the body using a Thermopile Sensor, amplifies the signal with an OpAmp, and interprets the temperature level using a millivolt VU meter. The OpAmp's high gain ensures signal amplification, and the non-inverting configuration maintains linearity.

## Simulations
Simulations, including Inverting Operational Amplifier Configuration, were conducted using TinkerCad. The circuit demonstrated linear variation between input and output signals, essential for accurate temperature interpretation.
